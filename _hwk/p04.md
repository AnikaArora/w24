# Today's Team Activity

This activity works with the paper that you were assigned to read:

* <https://pconrad.github.io/files/paper028.pdf>.

You do not need to have read the whole thing for today, but you need to have at least skimmed it.

* The title of this paper is *Listening to Early Career Developers* 
* I'll call this paper **LTD** for short (i.e. **L**istening **T**o **D**evelopers)

Our focus will be Section 4, which is divided into 6 sections:

| Section | Title | Academia | Industry | 
|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| 4.1 | What: Differences in Scope | well-defined, fixed scope | vague, open-ended, evolving scope |
| 4.2 | When: Short vs. Long Time Spans | short time spans (days, weeks)  | long time spans (months, years) |
| 4.3 | Who: Individual vs. Large Team | individuals, pairs, small groups  | larger teams |
| 4.4 | Why: Learning vs. User Needs | to learn something  | to address a user need |
| 4.5 | How: Ad-Hoc vs. Professional | ad-hoc tools and practices |  professional tools and formal practices |
| 4.6 | How Big: Small vs. Large Codebases | small programs | large complex systems |
{:.table .table-sm .table-striped .table-bordered}


You'll first assign one person from your team to each section; most teams have six people, so that's team member per section.

You might use the team slack channel, and use first-come,
first-served, or some other way to divide up the sections.

If one or more team members is absent, put a
slack message in your team channel mentioning them by `@`-ing them,
and letting them know which section(s) are left to be claimed.)

(While I don't think this applies today, because all teams currently have six members, but if someone does drop before this activity is completed, as as a result, you have fewer than six team members, you can decide to leave one
section uncovered.)

Then, please choose one member of the team as the team scribe (preferably, a different one from last time) that can share their screen.

That member of the team should go to the repo for your team on GitHub.  Here are links to these repos:

| 5pm | 6pm | 7pm |
|-----|-----|-----|
| [s23-5pm-1-NOTES](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s23/s23-5pm-1-NOTES) | [s23-6pm-1-NOTES](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s23/s23-6pm-1-NOTES) | [s23-7pm-1-NOTES](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s23/s23-7pm-1-NOTES)  |
| [s23-5pm-2-NOTES](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s23/s23-5pm-2-NOTES) | [s23-6pm-2-NOTES](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s23/s23-6pm-2-NOTES) | [s23-7pm-2-NOTES](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s23/s23-7pm-2-NOTES)  |
| [s23-5pm-3-NOTES](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s23/s23-5pm-3-NOTES) | [s23-6pm-3-NOTES](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s23/s23-6pm-3-NOTES) | [s23-7pm-3-NOTES](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s23/s23-7pm-3-NOTES)  |
| [s23-5pm-4-NOTES](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s23/s23-5pm-4-NOTES) | [s23-6pm-4-NOTES](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s23/s23-6pm-4-NOTES) | [s23-7pm-4-NOTES](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s23/s23-7pm-4-NOTES)  |
{:.table .table-sm .table-striped .table-bordered}


That should currently be an empty, private repo, accessible only to the course staff and the members of your team.   The scribe, when they bring up the repo,
will see something like the image shown below.  Click on the README link to create a README.md file:

<img width="556" alt="click-to-create-README-50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/230238329-f9b36fcf-43f3-414a-aa9e-86915d610261.png">


Then, your screen will look something like the image below:  
* You will see a text area where you can enter text for the README.md file for this repo.
* There are tabs to toggle between Edit and Preview; the format is Markdown, which is explained on [This Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)
* You may have to scroll down to find the "Commit New File" button, which is how you save your changes.

What content should you type?  Type a list of who is assigned to each section, something like this (you can copy/paste this, then edit it for your group)

The heading should look like this: <tt># Notes from {{ page.num }}</tt>

```
# Notes from (date)

Paper Section Assignments:

* 4.1: Alice Z.
* 4.2: Bob Y.
* 4.3: Chris X.
* 4.4: (unassigned)
* 4.5: Danny W.
* 4.6: Emily V.
```

Then, save the file and commit it to GitHub.

# Each person now creates a file for their section

Next, each member of the team (individually) should create a file pertaining to their own section.  You can do this by following the instructions/images below.

Note: Please follow the naming conventions shown below STRICTLY, including upper vs. lower-case letters.  


First, find the "Create New File" button:

<img width="164" alt="Create-new-file-50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/230238378-031d6091-c6de-446c-933a-2257cbb2c908.png">

Then, start typing the folder name <tt>{{page.num}}</tt>, as shown.

As soon as you type the forward slash `/`, you should see that the filename turns into a folder name.  
If you have made a typo, you can hit the delete/backspace key, and it should go back so you can edit the folder name.
(The screenshot shows `10.06` as the folder name; please use `{{ page.title }}` instead.)

<img width="209" alt="start-typing-folder-50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/230238395-7c2c2580-3bbf-44eb-ab5c-7f05e8c3c63f.png">

<img width="233" alt="after-typing-folder-50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/230238408-a23e09ee-e43d-40e7-804a-fb8a3b24fb4b.png">


Finally, name your file as shown in the example, and fill in content as shown in the example.  For now, we *only* need the heading; the content can come later.
The folder name should be <tt>{{page.num}}</tt> and the file name should be one of these: `sect4.1.md`, `sect4.2.md`, `sect4.3.md`, `sect4.4.md`, `sect4.5.md`, `sect4.6.md`. 

(The screenshot shows `10.06` as the folder name; please use `{{ page.title }}` instead.)

<img width="237" alt="fill-in-section-heading-50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/230238438-a730b59b-207e-4391-af4c-21ae4ee2e197.png">

You earn today's participation when you create your individual part of the repo. You only need the heading; no content yet, that's for Wednesday.


# What happens after today's class?

For lecture this coming Tuesday, please be prepared for a full discussion of the paper.  You'll also get a homework assignment tomorrow that will
be due next Tuesday.  There will be more questions to answer then.

# Checklist for today's work

1. Double check that someone on the team has set the `README.md` of your team's <tt>{{site.qxx}}-xpm-y-NOTES</tt> repo to have the correct content (list of who is assigned to which section, with a heading of<tt># Notes from {{ page.num }}</tt>

2. Double check that each member of the team that's present has create a file in that repo under a folder called <tt> {{ page.title }}</tt> with the correct content (a file that's one of (`sect4.1.md`, `sect4.2.md`, etc.) and that the content of that file matches the instructions above.  It only needs to be a header at this point.
  
3. Then, **submit a link to your repo** to [{{page.title}}]({{page.canvas_assignment_link}})

# What then?  
  
* Start on [jpa00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s23/lab/jpa00.html).
* If when you're done with [jpa00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s23/lab/jpa00.html) on CSIL, consider doing it again on your own machine, including doing all of the [software setup](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s23/info/software.html) needed for your machine.
* If you've done [jpa00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s23/lab/jpa00.html) on you own machine, consider doing it again on CSIL to make sure that your CSIL set up is valid (e.g. your `JAVA_HOME` settings and your ssh keys.)
