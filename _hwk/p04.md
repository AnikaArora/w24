For this participation assignment, there are just two requirements:
* You need to have created a CSIL account and be able to log in to it
* You need to have a public SSH key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) associated with your CSIL account

Detailed instructions on gradescope here: <{{page.gradescope_assignment_link}}>

Once you have those two things, you fill out the gradescope form, and you are finished.
Typically, 5-10 minutes.

We need this information to set up access to the servers where our web applications will
run in this course, so please do this short assignment as soon as possible once it is assigned.
