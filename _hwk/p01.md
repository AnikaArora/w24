To get credit for this activity, you need to join the course GitHub organization.  Instructions appear here:

* <{{page.canvas_url}}>

Students will be notified of this assignment starting in week 10 of Fall Quarter with periodic email reminders, though strictly speaking, the assignment cannot be officially given until the quarter starts, which happens {{page.assigned |  date: '%B %d, %Y at %l:%M %p' }}.

It will then be due {{page.due |  date: '%B %d, %Y at %l:%M %p' }}.

Students completing it after the due date/time will still get credit, since all students must complete this to be assigned to a team, but the credit will be reduced by 50%.

The grade will not automatically update in Canvas when you complete this;
the course staff have to do a manual process to update this grade.
It will be done periodically up to the deadline, and then once after the deadline has passed.
