# Introducting Today's Team Activity (2:00-2:30)

Today's activity involves populating a [Kanban board](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/kanban/) for team01.

Here are links to those kanban boards:

| 9am | 10am | 
|-----|-----|
| [9am-1]({{page.9am_1}}) | [10am-1]({{page.10am_1}}) | 
| [9am-2]({{page.9am_2}}) | [10am-1]({{page.10am_2}}) | 
| [9am-3]({{page.9am_3}}) | [10am-1]({{page.10am_3}}) | 
| [9am-4]({{page.9am_4}}) | [10am-1]({{page.10am_4}}) | 


You will also need to consult this Kanban board, which is an example for you to follow:

* [team01 example kanban board]({{page.example_board}})


# Step 0: Big Picture

Here's the big picture for team01:

* The team01 starter code has examples of CRUD operations for Restaurants with name/description
* You are going to add three more items to the Navbar for three things of your own choosing, each of which has at least three data fields. These could be anything you might want to be able to keep track of in a web application.
* For example, you might choose: Hotels, Movies, Books.
* You'll initially divide into three pairs, A, B and C, and then divide up the work 
  - For example, suppose Chris and Jin are on pair A, and they are working on Hotels
  - They probably should initially pair on the hotelFixtures.js and hotelUtilities.js
  - Then, Chris might initially work on the HotelForm, while Jin works on the HotelTable.
  - Then Chris might add the HotelCreate and HotelEdit pages, while Jin works on the HotelIndex and HotelDetails pages
  - However, that's just one way to divide up the work.  Another is that Chris and Jin could "pair program" on all of it.
  - How you divide up the work is up to you.
  - And: ultimately, the entire team is responsible for the entire effort, so help one another out as much as you can.
* Full instructions for team01 are coming soon, but as an overview: you'll be finished with team01 when you have:
  - A working web app for all three of the new items you added (plus the old stuff for Towns and Restaurants still works)
  - There is 100% test coverage both from `npm run coverage` and `npx stryker run`
  - `npx eslint --fix .` reports no problems
  - Everything is "green on CI", i.e. GitHub Actions gives you a green check, not a red X.
  - There are storybook stories published on the companion documentation site (more explanation on this later)
  - The README for your repo has a link to the companion documentation site.
  - You've turned in a link to your team01 repo on Canvas.

Today's work is to set up a Kanban board for you to track your efforts on the team01 project.

# Step 1: Make sure every team member has access to the board

Each team member should make sure they can bring up the team's Kanban board.

You can do this by making a post on your team's slack channel.

To reduce noise in the channel:
* The first person should post "I can access the team kanban board at" (then post the link).
* Everyone else can add a reply to that thread with "me too" or "I'm having trouble".

# Step 2: One member of the team: add the column for "In Review"

If you look at your team's board, you'll see that you have three columns; this is the default for a Kanban board in GitHub Projects.

Our practice, however, is to have another column between "In Progress" and "Done" called "In Review".

See, for example, the example board here: 
* [team01 example kanban board]({{page.example_board}})

Choose one member of the team to create that column with the name "In Review", the description "This is ready for code review" and the color "Pink".

# Step 3: Divide the team into three

Divide your team into three subteams, where each of these will be either a single person, or a pair working together.  Make a post on your slack channel indicating who is assigned to each subteam, e.g.

```
* Subteam A: Chris, Terry
* Subteam B: Riley
* Subteam C: Blake, Quinn
```

Then each of the three subteams will decide on some kind of object that you can use as the basis of building CRUD operations similar to the ones in the STARTER-team01 code for Restaurants.

Make a post to the slack channel in which you:
* Identify who is in your subteam
* State what you are going to build, and list what fields it will have.
  - Example: Hotel: name, address, description

# Step 4: Add tasks to your Kanban board

In GitHub projects, you can add two types of things to the columns on your Kanban board:

* Drafts: Drafts have very short text descriptions and appear only on the Kanban board.
* Issues: Issues are associated with a particular repo, and can have longer descriptions, and lots of additional data

We'll  start out with just drafts, and convert these to full issues in a later step.

Here's what it looks like to add draft issues to the TODO column:

![add-hotelFixtures](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/233477781-8a61b959-5b53-49d7-ad34-af48c4adff88.gif)


Divide into your subteams, and create the following cards in your TODO column for your item.  For sake of this example, I'll use "Hotel", but you should substitute your own item.

Add the following cards:

* Add hotelFixtures.js (example objects for testing)
* Add hotelUtilities.js (CRUD for Browser Local Storage)
* Add HotelForm component (form for create/edit)
* Add HotelTable component (table for index/details)
* Add HotelIndexPage (including link to it in navbar)
* Add HotelDetailsPage
* Add HotelCreatePage
* Add HotelEditPage

When you are done, there should be 24 cards in all.

# Step 5: Convert two drafts per subteam to a full issue


Here's what it looks like to convert a draft to a full issue.

![convert-draft-to-issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/233478826-155b9b78-b29b-42ec-b3b9-0544e59dc2ef.gif)

As you can see, part of this process requires you to select a repository. Select your team's team01 repo.

Now, *each subteam* should convert thes drafts to full issues: 
* Add hotelFixtures.js (example objects for testing)
* Add hotelUtilities.js (CRUD for Browser Local Storage)

Once you do that, you should see the issue on the issues tab on your team01 repo, like this:

![show-issues](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/233479083-d27421ec-06dd-4f21-9c1e-76f011c3cde2.gif)

When the full team is done, there should be six issues on your team01 repo.

# Step 6: In your subteam, assign issues to team members

Now assign the two issues to the subteam member(s).  If your subteam has two people, this is where you decide whether to work together as a pair (true pair programming), or divide and conquer (i.e. have one person work on one issue, while the other works on a different issue).

Here's what it looks like if you are doing true pairing (in this case, assume the pair is Avishek and Andrew):

![assign-issues-as-pair](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/233480194-92de0caf-8c0b-4c82-b901-ee7dbef76779.gif)

Here's what it looks like if you are dividing up the work:

![assign-issues-individually](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/233480831-3698fe62-ef40-40b1-bb6e-67bb752b4d35.gif)


Either way, when you are done, each member of the entire team is assigned to at least one issue.

# Step 7: Drag the issue to which you are assigned into the In Progress column

* If you are working as a pair on a single issue:
  - Just one of you: drag that issue *and only that issue* into the In Progress column
* If you are working as a pair on two separate issues:
  - Each of you separately: drag the issue you were assigned to into the In Progress column.

The idea is that from now until your full team is finished with all of team01, ideally, each team member is assigned to exactly one issue in the in-progress column (no more, and no less), until the team is done.

Note that even when your subteam is finished with all of it's issues, *your reponsibility to the full team is not over*, and you *still need to come to class and participate*.  If your subteam finishes first, at that point, your responsibility is to be a resource to the rest of the team to help them.  This may take many forms:
* Reviewing and merging their pull requests
* Dividing up your subteam and pairing with members that are running into problems or are stuck.

The purpose of the subteam is to suggest an initial division of labor&mdash;having said that, ultimately, *all* of the work is the responsibillity of the *entire* team.

Completing all of the issues in your TODO column can be considered a single *sprint*.

# Step 8: Reviewing your work as a team

When each subteam has completed the steps above, you are ready to check in and make sure your team has finished the work for {{page.title}}.  Here's the checklist:

* Subteams documented in slack, with who's one which subteam, what they are adding, and what fields will be on their forms.
* Kanban board has an In Review column between In Progress and Done, with specified title/description/color
* 24 draft issues on the Kanban board under Todo, with 6 of those converted to full issues
* Each team member assigned to exactly one issue in In Progress (whether as an individual or as a pair)

When that's done, you'll submit the link to your Kanban board for the P06 assignment on Canvas, and you are done!

# What then?

You have a few choices:

* Work/Get help on jpa02 if needed
* Start setting up your team01 repo by pulling from starter code here: <{{team01_starter}}>
* Start work on your in progress issue:
  - You should create a feature branch
  - You may want to discuss a branch naming convention with your team.
