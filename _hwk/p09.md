# Introducing Today's Participation Activity 

Today's there are two separate participation activity is an *individual* activity.

It involves *two tasks*, each of which you *might* already have done if you have continued with the steps of team01.

1. Creating a branch other than main for working on your first issue, the "service" you were assigned to.

  - Note that the service you were assigned to is one of these:`JokeQueryService`, `LocationQueryService`, `PublicHolidayQueryService`,
    `TidesQueryService`, `UniversityQueryService`, `ZipCodeQueryService`
  - You can see the branches that have been created for your repo here:

    | [f23-5pm-1 branches](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f23/team01-f23-5pm-1/branches) | [f23-5pm-2 branches](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f23/team01-f23-5pm-2/branches) | [f23-5pm-3 branches](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f23/team01-f23-5pm-3/branches) | [f23-5pm-4 branches](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f23/team01-f23-5pm-4/branches) | 
    | [f23-6pm-1 branches](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f23/team01-f23-6pm-1/branches) | [f23-6pm-2 branches](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f23/team01-f23-6pm-2/branches) | [f23-6pm-3 branches](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f23/team01-f23-6pm-3/branches) | [f23-6pm-4 branches](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f23/team01-f23-6pm-4/branches) | 
    | [f23-7pm-1 branches](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f23/team01-f23-7pm-1/branches) | [f23-7pm-2 branches](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f23/team01-f23-7pm-2/branches) | [f23-7pm-3 branches](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f23/team01-f23-7pm-3/branches) | [f23-7pm-4 branches](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f23/team01-f23-7pm-4/branches) | 

  - Your branch name should be something like your name or initials, followed by the service you are working on, e.g. `CG-Tides-Service` or `ChrisZipSvc` etc.
  - If you see a branch with your initials, and your name, you have completed this first step.
  - If you don't see your branch on Github, please look at [Step 2.2a and complete this step today in lab](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f23/lab/team01.html#step-22a-make-a-first-commit)

2. Creating a *personal* deployment on Dokku for team01.

   - To do this, you should follow the steps under [Step 2.7 of team01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f23/lab/team01.html#step-27-deploy-your-branch-to-a-dev-deployment).
   - Note that you can do this even if you haven't finished steps 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 yet; all you need is a branch other than main, which you now have
     if you completed step 2.2a.
    
Once you are done with those two steps, to submit on Canvas, you need to do something a little different:

* Today, we want TWO web links 



Then, just continue with team01 from wherever you are.

The goal should be to have at least the service completed before class on Thursday, so that everyone in class can do at least one "code review".  If you can have both
the service and controller done before class on Thursday, that's even better.   It's good to aim for a pace a bit faster than the deadlines so that there's time to get help in case something goes wrong.
