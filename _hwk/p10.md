There are two participation assignments today, both individual.  (The other is [p11](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w24/hwk/p11/)).

The first is for your team standup participation, which, to count:
* must be on Slack, and must be during the first 10 minutes of class.
* and **must be submitted on Canvas by 5:30pm**

The essence of a standup meeting, as we'll discuss, is *showing up for your team* and sharing with them your status, as well as anything blocking your progress.

So, the whole essence of this is that it can't be *made up later*.   You either show up, or you don't.

Note that for purposes of the participation assignment, showing up on Slack/Zoom counts as showing up, so even if you are sick,
you should be able to handle showing up on Slack/Zoom for the first 10 minutes of class.

# What you need to do

Make a slack post in which you:
* Indicate what you've done so far on team01
* Anything that is blocking your progress
* When you expect to be finished with your service and controller

Then submit a link to that Slack post on Canvas here: <{{page.canvas_assignment_link}}>

For the participation assignment, that's all you have to do.

However, to make it a proper "standup", after everyone has put in their posts on slack, please:
* Get any remote participants on zoom dialed in
* Everyone physically present, that is able to, please stand (physically standup)
* Have everyone share their standup update out loud
* When all finished, everyone sits back down.
