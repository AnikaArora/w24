# Today's Team Activity

This activity works with the paper that you were assigned to read:

* <https://pconrad.github.io/files/paper028.pdf>.

Each of you contributed some text to a repo when working on 
[p04](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s23/hwk/p04/) and 
[h00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s23/hwk/h00/).

Here are links to those repos:

# Step 1: Organizing your First Group (Twelve *different* teams of six) (5 minutes)

Your first breakout group will be with other people that read the same section as you.  

If you are in the 5pm discussion section, or you are on 6pm-1 or 6pm-2,
these are the tables for your first breakout group.

| Section | Table for all of 5pm <br /> and 6pm-1, 6pm-2 | Table for 6pm-3, 6pm-4, and all of 7pm |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 4.1     | 1 | 7 |
| 4.2     | 2 | 8 |
| 4.3     | 3 | 9 |
| 4.4     | 4 | 10 |
| 4.5     | 5 | 11 |
| 4.6     | 6 | 13 |

On zoom: scroll down past the breakout rooms for your teams, past the numbered breakout rooms, and look for breakout rooms labeled: `ltd-1`, `ltd-2`, etc. up through `ltd-11, ltd-13` (the numbers correspond to the table numbers.)

<img width="427" alt="ltd-breakout-rooms" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/231276945-b7bc6a78-74a6-434b-bea4-c3ca61640fb8.png">

Join the appropriate group.

**On Zoom, you will have to join the breakout room manually**.  You will not be placed in these rooms by default.

Each group should choose one person as the "time keeper", and a second person as the "scribe". 

Then, go on the course slack, <https://ucsb-cs156-{{page.qxx}}.slack.com>.  You should find that there is a dropdown where you locate channels.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/113913264-f798c080-9790-11eb-8ff9-ac528e786d81.png)

Find the slack channel for your table/group and join it, e.g. `#ltd-4-1-table-1`, `#ltd-4-2-table-8`, etc.  Please note that you will not necessarily see the channel: you'll have to search for it.

Here are the channel names:

<img width="277" alt="slack-ltd-breakout-rooms" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/231277165-a3814fa7-8be5-495d-a310-80a374708447.png">

Once you've joined that channel, make a post with your name and pronouns, and identifying which group you are a part of (by your table number).   There will be roughly 6 of you per group if there is full attendance.

# Step 2a: Extra Steps for the scribe and timekeeper (5 minutes)

The timekeeper should login to the computer at your team's table in SH1431,  join the zoom
room, and then join the zoom breakout room for this team.  Take note of any team members that
are participating via zoom.

The scribe should:

1. Log into to zoom and join the zoom room for the team.
2. Log into Slack and join the channel for the team.
3. Share their screen so that as they take notes, everyone can follow along.


# Step 2b: Individual, 5 minutes

Find your team's repo, and your contribution to it.  Read it over again, and perhaps also skim the section of the paper, to remind you about what you read, and what you wrote.

The link to the paper is here:  <https://pconrad.github.io/files/paper028.pdf>


# Step 3: Sharing responses (30 minutes)

Next, you'll each share with the group your responses to this question"

* Question: Based on what you've learned from this paper, **what skills would be helpful for students to learn in this class to be well prepared for industry**

The timekeeper should give each member of the room *exactly 4 minutes* to share their responses to this question. You can reaffirm what others have said, but its even better if you can add something that
wasn't already mentioned.

* The timekeeper should go last, and someone else should time them. 
* The scribe should ask someone else to scribe while they give their report.   

When each person has finished:
* Make a <tt>{{page.title}} Step 3 Done!</tt> post in your team channel (e.g. `#ltd-4-1-table-7`).
* Everyone should return to the main room
* The scribe should make a post on the `#help-lecture-discussion` channel to indicate that the group is finished, e.g. <tt>ltd-4-1-table-7 {{page.title}} Step 3 Done!</tt>

Stay at your table until the signal is given, and then everyone will move back to their original team tables / zoom rooms.

# Step 4: (Second Breakout Group, 15 minutes)

When the instructor signals, everyone gets up and returns to their original team tables, zoom rooms and slack channels.  

Again, choose a  scribe and timekeeper, and post the names of those folks to your team channel, along with the names of who is present/absent.  

(If everyone is present you can just say: "everyone present"; actively participating synchronously on zoom counts as being "present").

Then, each member of the team should report on their portion of the paper, starting with section 4.1, then 4.2, etc.  This time, **give each team member 2 minutes**.

The scribe should write a summary in the team's slack channel capturing the discussion.

You may refer to the notes from the `#ltd-4-1-table-1`, `#ltd-4-2-table-2` etc. channels on the slack
channel on Slack, or just report from you own memory, as you see fit.

# Step 4: (Still in Second Breakout Group, 15 minutes)

Now, in your same breakout room, make a list (as a group) of (at least) **six learning goals** you have between now and the end of the course, i.e. things that you want to "be able to do" by the end of this course.

They may relate 1-1 to the six themes in the paper, or they may be different; the point is that they are things that are meaningful
to the members of your group, knowing what you know from your own experiences, as well as what you've learned from this paper.

Put that list on your team's Slack channel (e.g. team-4pm-a, etc.), along with a list of the names of the group members that contributed to your discussion.

Example:
```
By the end of the course, we will be able to:
* Use GitHub to manage group work in a team (how)
* Understand how to get started with a new large code base (how big)
etc.
```

Ideally, you'd come up with at least one learning goal that corresponds to each of the six sections of the paper.   It's ok if you have more than six.

When you are done, make a post in the team's slack channel with <tt>{{page.title}} Step 4: Done!</tt>

# Step 5: Finishing up (check in with staff)

When that's done, you are almost finished with today's lecture activity; last steps are for the scribe:

Scribe: be sure that your team's channel contains 
(1) a post with the scribe / timekeeper and attendance for today's activity
(2) summary of what your team members reported back
(3) learning goals for your team.
(4) the <tt>{{page.title}} Step 4: Done!</tt> post 

Once that's done, grab the URL of the Slack post with the scribe/timekeeper and attendance (i.e. where the Step 4 discussion started) and post that to the {{page.title}} assignment on Canvas.

Then you are done with today's class!
