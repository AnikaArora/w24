This homework assignment is intended to be done sometime during the period that the
team is working on team01.

Your task is to perform at least one "code review" on a "pull request" for your team.

You can find the list of available PRs to review at the links below:

A code review can have three possible outcomes:
* Approve, along with a comment such as "Looks Good To Me" or LGTM for short.
* Approve, along with some specific comment of praise for good code, suggestions for improvement, and/or questions about parts of the code (which, given that it's an "approve", might or might not be seen and responded to by the code author)
* Request Changes.  In this case, there should be some specific questions or suggestions that the code author must respond to in some way.  A second round of code review is then done.

To get credit for this assignment, any of these is acceptable.  In a future assignment, I may require some specific comments on the code.  You are encouraged to 
practice that in this round, even though it's not a requirement of the assignment.

# How to do a code review

There is a specific set of steps that need to be taken in a code review; you can read more about that at this link:

* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/code_reviews/code_reviews_github.html>

There is also an article about what kinds of things to look for in a Code Review:

# Submitting on Canvas

To submit on Canvas, submit a link to the pull request.  That will be something like this:
* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f23/team01-f23-6pm-1/pull/20>

Somewhere on that page should be something like this:



Submit here on Canvas: <{{page.canvas_assignment_link}}>
