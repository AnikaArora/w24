This homework assignment is intended to be done sometime during the period that the
team is working on team01.

Your task is to perform at least one "code review" on a "pull request" for your team.

You can find the list of available PRs to review at the links below.  Only PRs that have a green check should be reviewed (e.g. <img width="327" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/f23/assets/1119017/f5db3072-bfa6-4676-b2ea-b6edfa3163a9">,  but NOT <img width="398" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/f23/assets/1119017/013711a6-7277-4987-8a0a-c57d518e28cc">

A code review can have three possible outcomes:
* Approve, along with a comment such as "Looks Good To Me" or LGTM for short.
* Approve, along with some specific comment of praise for good code, suggestions for improvement, and/or questions about parts of the code (which, given that it's an "approve", might or might not be seen and responded to by the code author)
* Request Changes.  In this case, there should be some specific questions or suggestions that the code author must respond to in some way.  A second round of code review is then done.

To get credit for this assignment, any of these is acceptable.  In a future assignment, I may require some specific comments on the code.  You are encouraged to 
practice that in this round, even though it's not a requirement of the assignment.

# How to do a code review

There is a specific set of steps that need to be taken in a code review; you can read more about that at this link:

* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/code_reviews/code_reviews_github.html>

There is also an article about what kinds of things to look for in a Code Review:

# Submitting on Canvas

To submit on Canvas, submit a link to the pull request.  That will be something like this:
* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f23/team01-f23-6pm-1/pull/20>

If you did it correctly, somewhere on that page should be something like this.  

<img width="951" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/f23/assets/1119017/1dc19036-0f8c-4bd8-af0a-6ba93dcc260f">

* It's important that it not *only* be the text <img width="218" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/f23/assets/1119017/448d6d57-85ff-4c7c-9cee-bc1c8f21fef9">
* To be a proper approving code review, it *must* have this part: <img width="939" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/f23/assets/1119017/8d7ceb39-6574-437b-9ea9-e1990967a7d4">
* If you don't have that text, see this article on how to do it properly: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/code_reviews/code_reviews_github.html>

Then **submit here on Canvas**: <{{page.canvas_assignment_link}}>
