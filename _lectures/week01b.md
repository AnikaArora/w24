# Please sit with your team:

The goals for today are to complete `P04` as a team and start on `jpa00` as individuals (but please feel free to help each other). If you still have time left over, `H00` has also been assigned.

* [P04]({{page.p04_assignment_link}}) - due by the end of discussion today
* [jpa00]({{page.jpa00_assignment_link}}) - due by {{page.jpa00_due_date |  date: '%B %d, %Y at %l:%M %p' }}
* [H00]({{page.h00_assignment_link}}) - due by {{page.h00_due_date |  date: '%B %d, %Y at %l:%M %p' }}
