The participation activity for today:
* Find your jpa03-yourGithubId repo.
* Clone it to a directory on your laptop (this one will NOT work well on CSIL).
* Add a remote for the starter code
* Pull from the starter code, and then push to your jpa03 repo.

You should do AT LEAST this much of jpa03 during section today to get the participation grade.

I will be setting up a p07 on Canvas as a place where you can paste the link to your jpa03 repo
so that we can check that each of you has gotten at least this far.

Once you've done that, you may then pick up with whatever lab from jpa01, jpa02, or jpa03 you are not finished with yet.

To clarify:
* Q: Are we required to attend section in person today?
* A: No, though you are encouraged to do so, if you can, and are healthy, for all the reasons listed above.
Having said that:

* It's fine to work from home.
* You don't have to login to zoom unless you have a question for the TAs/LAs.
* You should, however, monitor these three slack channels during your assigned section time, regardless of whether you are in person or remote:
  * Your team channel
  * `#announcements`
  * `#help-jpa03`
  * And use `#help-lecture-discussion` if you need help (whether in person or remote.)

Here is today's participation assignment.  Please complete it before your section ends today.
* p07: <https://ucsb.instructure.com/courses/14657/assignments/175519>

When you've finished with that:
* If not finished with jpa01, work on that.
* If not finished with jpa02, work on that.
* Then, do the rest of jpa03 (including getting it working on both localhost, and on dokku)

jpa03 requires no programming, but a lot of configuration and setup.
* a new dokku app, like in jpa02, but also
* a postgres database (new for jpa03)
* Google OAuth authentication (new for jpa03)
* Github Pages site
* Github Actions (the green check, vs. the red x)

All of the skills in jpa03 are things you'll be doing many of times over the rest of the course, so it's important to understand how they work.
