# Summary of today's notes

* Today in lecture: Work on jpa01, jpa02, jpa03.
* **jpa01 is due by end of lecture.**
* If done, come to help others.
* If not done, let your teammates know where you stand.
* The goal is to wrap it all up by Tuesday so we can start the team projects.
* Come in person if you can, though it's not required today.
* The zoom room will be open, but only for asking for help (use `#help-lecture-discussion` to ask for help and specify that you are on zoom.)
* If you don't come in person, please at least check on your slack channel with a post about where you are with jpa01, jpa02, jpa03, and whether you need help, or can offer help.
* Get your laptop setup for both Java (JDK, and maven) and Javascript (nvm, node, npm)
* Monitor slack during lecture/section, especially `#announcements`, your team's channel, and `#help-`*xxx* where *xxx* is the assignment you are working on.

# Work on jpa00, jpa01, jpa02 today

This coming Tuesday, we will be starting our first team project, so it is important to come in person, or if that's not feasible/wise (due to illness or other reason) to at least participate live, synchronously, on zoom/slack.

Today, however, we are going to devote the entire lecture period to trying to help every member of your team make as much progress as possible on jpa01, jpa02, and jpa03.


# Try to finish up all three by this weekend, or by Monday

It is important that everyone on the team try to finish all three of these (jpa01, jpa02, jpa03) before this coming Tuesday's lecture if possible.  Reason: that will give you the needed preparation for the first team exercise.   So that's a target of Tuesday 10/17 1:59pm for all three.


The *actual* deadlines are:
* jpa01: due: tonight (Thursday 1/18) by 11:59pm, grace period with no penalty until Friday 10/19 11:59pm
* jpa02: due Wednesday 1/24 11:59, grace period with no penalty until Thursday 1/25 11:59pm
* jpa03: due Thursday 1/25 11:59pm, grace period with no penalty until Monday 10/29 11:59pm

But please try to finish all three before the weekend if you can, or at the latest, on Monday, so that you can all give your full attention to the new team project starting Tuesday.

# Do we have to come in person today?

Accordingly, though you aren't required to come in person today, I want to encourage you to do so if you are healthy, even if you are finished with jpa01, jpa02, and jpa03, so that you can help others on your team.

# Help your teammates, help the team

It is to the benefit of the entire team to have everyone up to speed.

If you are finished with all three, you are encouraged to let your teammates know, and make yourself available to them to help them finish.  Conversely, if you are not finished with all three, you are encouraged to let your teammates know where you are and to ask for help.


# Get your laptop set up

One other thing: as part of jpa03, everyone needs to have their personal laptop setup for both Java (java and maven) and Javascript (nvm, node).

So, please help one another with that as well.

# Monitor these slack channel always (esp during lecture/discussion)

Every class, whether you come in person or not, please monitor these slack channels during all assigned lecture/lab times:

* `#announcements`
* Your team channel, e.g. `#f23-5pm-1`, `#f23-5pm-2`, etc.  This is where you ask your teammates for help or offer help.
* The help channel of whatever current assignments you aren't finished with e.g. `#help-jpa01`, `#help-jpa02`, `#help-jpa03`
* And use `#help-lecture-discussion` when asking for help from the staff.
