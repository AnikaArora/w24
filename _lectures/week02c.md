[Slides]({{page.slides}})


First, before anything else, please do this quick participation assignment:

* p08: <https://www.gradescope.com/courses/540990/assignments/2969670>

Please work on these assignments:

* If not finished, please work on <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f23/lab/jpa01.html>
  - By the end of lab today, please try to *at least* get to the part that says:
    ```
    First, Add stubs for all of the methods that donâ€™t have them yet.
    ...
    Then, try submitting on Gradescope
    ```
    You should have a submission on Gradescope for jpa01 by end of your discussion section, even if
    it still is not passing some tests.

    You do have until the deadline on Gradescope (07/13 11:59pm) to finish, but please try to at least make a submission today.
     
* If/when you are done with jpa01, please try this lab: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f23/lab/jpa02.html>

Also: over the next few days, if you are stuck on jpa01 and are waiting to come in for office hours, please go ahead and start jpa02.

Jpa02 is much more straightforward; you should be able to complete it fairly quickly.
