Final Pull Requests for legacy code projects are due by 9am today.

Each of those should be code reviewed by a team member by noon today.

After that, the only work will be work necessary to get those remaining PRs merged (e.g. responding to peer and/or staff code reviews.)

# If your team is already at 100 points

Look ahead to the lecture notes for next Tuesday;
you can start on your team's final video presentation.
