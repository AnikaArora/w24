# First thing: Note on Team Slack Channel

Please make a note on your team slack channel (one per team is enough).

* Either: `team02 submitted`
* Or: `team02 still in progress`

Then, complete P13, depending on which of these applies to you:

# P13: If finished with team02 

Do your second Retro.  Click the triangle for details

Details of how to do Retro 2
</summary>

* Review how to do a retro: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html>
* Then, go to your folder on Google Drive (the link should be pinned to your slack channel)
* Create a new document Retro2 similar to Retro1
* Conduct a retro following the same basic instructions from here:
  - <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/m23/lectures/week05a/#retrospective-the-heart-of-agile>

One change to the instructions: before deciding on a new experiment, have a discussion of the experiment from your last retro.
- Read the experiment from your Retro1 document.
- In your Retro2 document, make a section "Last Retros Experiment"
- Copy/paste the description of the experiment.
- Then, invite each member of the team to write something on the slack channel indicating whether they thought
  the experiment had a successful outcome, a failed outcome, an indeterminate outcome (can't tell) or a mix,
  and why.  But don't press enter until there's a signal that everyone is finished.
- Then you call all press enter and see what each other wrote.
- Discuss. If possible come to a consensus summary.  If a consensus doesn't emerge after a few minutes of discussion,
  then you can "agree to disagree".
- Write down either a summary of your consensus, or a summary of your differing opinions.

Then, come up with a new experiment for this Retro.  It can be a variation on the old one (i.e. a different approach to the same problem), or could be entirely different (some other aspect of the team's performance.)

# P13: If NOT finished with team02 

* Do a standup on the team slack channel
* Make a note on the slack channel of any team members that are not participating in class today
* Then do an out loud standup
* Next, Review the Kanban board as a team
* Finally, get to work (collaboratively) on whatever needs to be done to get team02 finished.

Remember that you work as a team, so if you are done with "your part", help other team members with "their parts".

# When will team03 be ready

Really soon!  Perhaps even before Thursday; I'll ping you all as soon as it's done.
