Today, we briefly reviewed a few things:

# jpa02

* Heroku has started charging some students, so if you want to delete your Heroku account, go ahead.
* You can reimplement on Dokku if you didn't already get a grade for jpa02
  - Dokku seems reasonably fast, and it's implemented by [UCSB CoE ECI](https://eci.ucsb.edu/)
  - You use it with your CSIL account
  - <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/dokku/>
* jpa02 is due Wednesday night at midnight, so try to finish up

# team01

Remember that it's a *team* project and a *team* grade.

When you've done your part, chip in to help the rest of the team get finished.
