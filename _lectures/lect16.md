Today:
* (1)  Post a standup update in your team’s slack channel:
  - (a) what have you done on team02 since last Thursday’s class?
  - (b) what are you working on now?
  - (c) do you have any blocking issues?
  And a bonus question:
  - (d) what do you think you’ll have done by discussion section time tomorrow?
* (2) Do an “out loud” standup as a team
* (3) Work on your issues related to team02, getting help from staff as needed.

As of right now, I’m not planning on any announcements; we’ll go right into this as soon as you arrive in class.
