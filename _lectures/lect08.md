Today, we started on a "Hello World" type application for Spring Boot web applications.

There are two versions.  You only have to do one or the other.
* [jpa02h (Heroku)](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/m23/lab/jpa02h.html)
* [jpa02r (Render)](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/m23/lab/jpa02r.html)

(Note: in the future, we'll probably use Dokku for this instead of Heroku or Render.)
