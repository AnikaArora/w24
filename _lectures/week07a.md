# Outline for today, Tuesday August 8th:

* Please do a standup update, both in team slack channel, and out loud with your team.
* The deadline for team03 is midnight Monday 08/14, one week from today, STRICT.
* Everyone needs to be ready to start the legacy code project on Tuesday 08/15.

BUT if you think your team will be done with team03 sooner:
* Give me a heads up so I can try to be ready to transition your team to the legacy code project by Thursday 08/10, Friday 08/11.

If/when you do finish your legacy code project before Tuesday 08/15:
* please go ahead and do Retro3, following the same instructions as before (including an analysis of your Experiment from Retro2.)
