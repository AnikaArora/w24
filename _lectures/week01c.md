# jpa00/jpa01

* Please finish [jpa00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f23/lab/jpa00.html) today in section if you haven't yet.
* If you have, then please start on [jpa01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f23/lab/jpa01.html).

You may find parts of it confusing if you haven't worked with Java before; if that's the case,
us that to motivate yourself to read through the readings suggested in the assignment.
