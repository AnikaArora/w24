# Today's Agenda

* Work on team02

# If done with team02

Explore the four Happy Cows implementations where you have admin access:
* <https://proj-happycows-s23-6pm-1.dokku-12.cs.ucsb.edu/>
* <https://proj-happycows-s23-6pm-2.dokku-12.cs.ucsb.edu/>
* <https://proj-happycows-s23-6pm-3.dokku-12.cs.ucsb.edu/>
* <https://proj-happycows-s23-6pm-4.dokku-12.cs.ucsb.edu/>

You can try creating a new commons (it's on the Admin menu).

Notice the different features.

Also, try running the jobs (updating cow health, and milking the cows.)
