# If you didn't do a retro on team02 Tuesday, do it today

Remember that a decent retro should take at least 30 minutes.

If you are done faster, maybe you aren't going deep enough.

As you put down your stop/start/continue items, ask yourself: are the items specific?

For example:
- if you say: "start project sooner" as a "start" item, can you be more specific about what you mean by sooner?
- if you say: "stop getting sidetracked" as a "stop" item, can you be more specific about what circumstances are causing you get sidetracked?

You may know at the time of the discussion, but if you come back to it a week or two later, you might not remember.
So try to be as specific as possible.

# Check your team02 retro document: did you analyze last retro's experiment?

Whether you did your team02 retro on Tuesday, or you're doing it today, make
sure that it includes all of the things from retro1 PLUS an analysis of your
experiment from last time.

# If/when done with team02 retro, start on team03.

First, everyone read through the writeup here:
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f23/lab/team03.html>

Then, divide up the six tables and note who is doing what on your Slack channel.
* It can be the the same tables as for team02, or you can switch things up.
* It's fine either way.  

Then, be sure that you assign yourself an issue and drag it to the In Progress column, and then get started!

Details of how to do Retro 2
</summary>

* Review how to do a retro: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html>
* Then, go to your folder on Google Drive (the link should be pinned to your slack channel)
* Create a new document Retro2 similar to Retro1
* Conduct a retro following the same basic instructions from here:
  - <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f23/lectures/week05a/#retrospective-the-heart-of-agile>

One change to the instructions: before deciding on a new experiment, have a discussion of the experiment from your last retro.
- Read the experiment from your Retro1 document.
- In your Retro2 document, make a section "Last Retros Experiment"
- Copy/paste the description of the experiment.
- Then, invite each member of the team to write something on the slack channel indicating whether they thought
  the experiment had a successful outcome, a failed outcome, an indeterminate outcome (can't tell) or a mix,
  and why.  But don't press enter until there's a signal that everyone is finished.
- Then you call all press enter and see what each other wrote.
- Discuss. If possible come to a consensus summary.  If a consensus doesn't emerge after a few minutes of discussion,
  then you can "agree to disagree".
- Write down either a summary of your consensus, or a summary of your differing opinions.

Then, come up with a new experiment for this Retro.  It can be a variation on the old one (i.e. a different approach to the same problem), or could be entirely different (some other aspect of the team's performance.)
