# Announcements 

CATME Survey:
* Thanks to the 31/33 students that have filled it out!
* To the other two: i've pinged you.  Please take time after standup, and the brief HappyCows intro to do it in class today.
* We should have 100% particpation by the end of class today.

We'll do standup after today's partipation activity.

# Participation Activity P12: HappyCows

Time: 2:01 - 2:11pm

* <https://ucsb.instructure.com/courses/10130/assignments/148617>

This participation activity is intended to be done during class today, Thursday 07/23/2023.

However, you may do it before class if you like.

One of the legacy code apps that we'll be working with in the last few weeks of the course is HappyCows, a simulation game used in Chem 123, a course in Environmental Chemistry at UCSB, taught by Prof. Mattanjah de Vries.

Today, your assignment is to play the game a little bit. 

Specifically, to earn today's participation grade:

* Login at <https://happycows.dokku-00.cs.ucsb.edu>
* Find the Commons *CMPSC 156 M23* and **join** it. 
  * Please leave the other commons, "Summer Meadows Homestead", alone—that's for Prof. de Vries' class.
* Once you've joined the commons, you can visit it.
* Please buy at least one cow. 
* Once you've bought a cow, you can then check on your cow in Section tomorrow. You should see that the cows were milked, as as a result, you now have some more money with which to buy more cows.

That's all you must do.  However, if you like, you may:

* Buy more cows; as many as you have money for.  But keep in mind that the commons can only support 500 cows; after there are 500 total, the cows health starts to go down.
* Try buying and selling cows
* Check out the leaderboard to see what's happening with other players
* Please just make sure that you have bought at least one cow so that we can check you off for today's participation activity.

## Submitting P12 on Canvas

Joining the CMPSC 156 M23 game and buying at least one cow is all you must to do to earn the points for the participation assignment.   When you've done those four things, submit on Canvas.

For your submission, please write at least the word "Done".  That's the minimum requirement—and if you are still busy with team02, it's probably best to just do that and pivot back to team02 (or filling out CATME if you haven't done that yet).

But, if you have a few minutes, and some thoughts, you are also encouraged, though not required, to spend a few minutes looking at the game, and writing about your experience:

* Is anything confusing?
* Do you see anything you would change?
* Is the point of the game clear or unclear?
* Can you think of any features you would add?
* What questions do you have about the game?

Note that this isn't the last and only opportunity for these discussions; we'll come back to this question about HappyCows later. So you can leave this for now, and if you have thoughts later, you can add them to the `#proj-happycows` channel on Slack.

# Standup (approx 2:15-2:20)

Please do a standup both on Slack and out loud.   

* This may be for a participation grade, or not
* My hope, as I've said before, is to reduce the number of these over time.
* I don't want to be micromanaging your participation
* On the other hand, if there are some folks that are not showing up, I do want to make sure those folks are held accountable, and get the message that showing up for the team is important.
* So, from now until the end of the class, standup may, on any given day, be for a participation grade.
* Please do plan to show up, and please do your best to be on time.

Bottom Line:
* If you must unavoidably be late for&mdash;or absent from&mdash;class, at least post a message to your team, including a standup update.


# Remainder of class: work session on team02

## Staff Info

Information under the triangle is for staff.  You are welcome to look at it, but it's probably not that interesting.

Grading for P12, possibly P13
</summary>

Staff:  Please check P12 on Canvas
* For each submission, check on <https://happycows.dokku-00.cs.ucsb.edu> that the student has bought at least one cow
* You should be able to see this on the leaderboard

Then, check each team and compare:
* the team membership here: <https://bit.ly/cs156-m23-teams>
* with who posted a slack update on their team channel

If you see anyone that is missing, ping them on their team channel to see if they are online, and perhaps just didn't do a slack update.

But if they are missing, make a note of it on the #staff channel.  We might make P13 a participation activity for whether or not
folks participated in standup today.  (See my notes above in the student facing notes.)
